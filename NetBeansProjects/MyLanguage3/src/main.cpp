/**
 * This program reads an undefined number of Language objects from the set of 
 * files passed as parameters to main(). All the Languages object, except the 
 * first one, must be stored in a dynamic array of Language objects. Then, 
 * for each Language in the dynamic array, this program prints to the 
 * standard output the name of the file of that Language and the distance from 
 * the first Language to the current Language. 
 * Finally, the program should print in the standard output, the name of 
 * the file with the Language with the minimum|maximum distance to the Language 
 * of the first file and its language identifier.
 * 
 * At least, two Language files are required to run this program.
 * Running example:
 * > language3 [-t min|max] <file1.bgr> <file2.bgr> [  ... <filen.bgr>]
